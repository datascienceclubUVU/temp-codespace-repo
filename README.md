## **WELCOME TO THE "INTRO TO MLOPS AND ML ENGINEERING" WORKSHOP!**

### **DESCRIPTION:**
##### In this workshop, we'll explore the ML Lifecycle in an end-to-end fashion by creating a model that solves a real-world problem.

### **CONTEXT:**
##### A family member is currenly on the market for a new car but would like to avoid buying from a Used Car Dealer. However, they have very little experience with understanding how to identify a good deal on a Used Car Listing. They are requesting your help in predicting the price of a specific listing given its parameters.

##### To solve this problem, we will build a Decision Tree Regression Model to predict the price of a Used Car given its various features.

### **INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. "pip install" the following libraries:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- plotly
- pyarrow
- pandasql
- streamlit
2. Go to the "price-prediction.ipynb" file.
3. Run the Streamlit App by running the following command in the Terminal:
   "streamlit run PricePredicitonApp.py"
